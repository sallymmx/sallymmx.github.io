<AboutCard :frontmatter="$page.frontmatter" >

I have attended the College of Computer Science & Technology,  Zhejiang University of Technology as a faculty in 2024. My research area includes Robotic Embodied Intelligence, Compute Vision and Multi-media Technology, specifically including video action recognition, object tracking, object detection, depth estimation, text-to-image editing and so on. :dizzy:

My works have been published on top computer vision transactions/conferences (TPAMI, TIP, TMM, CVPR, ICCV, ICLR, AAAI etc) and top robotic conferences (ICRA, IROS).
